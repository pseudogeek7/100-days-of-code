# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Apr 29, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Building on already held basic knowledge of ReactJS, started with dev of YT Browser React App featuring:
	a. Search Videos using YT Api
	b. Render List of Videos fetched from YT Api
	c. Show/ Play a YT video on browser
2.	1a and 1b are done.

**Thoughts:**
1. Hands on react core concepts like controlled components/ tags, 
2. Struggled with revisiting concepts of callbacks/ props and implementation of axios method for YT API
3. Progress is slow but steady, hoping to increase pace with time.
